****

I got silver medal in the 25th Scientific Olympiad in Computer Engineering.

I also took this exam last year which I was not prepared enough. I just wanted to measure my knowlege. However, this year, as I was studying for University Exam, I studied for Olympiad. That is because questions asked in each exam is very different. I've also written my whole experience in Farsi Here.

This is my exam results for last year. It was quite a good experience to speak to great people and find new friends.

Let's stop it here and return later.
