I won a silver medal in the 25th Scientific Olympiad in Computer Engineering.

Last year, I took this exam, but I wasn't prepared enough. I just wanted to measure my knowledge. In addition to studying for my University Exam, I also prepared for Olympiad. As a result, I gained a solid understanding of subjects such as Algorithms, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Computer Architecture, and also Digital Design.

I've also written my whole experience in Farsi [Here](https://vrgl.ir/1Fdhk "Olympiad Experience").
