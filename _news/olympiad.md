I got a silver medal in the 25th Scientific Olympiad in Computer Engineering.

I also took this exam last year, which I was not prepared enough. I just wanted to measure my knowledge. However, this year, as I was studying for University Exam, I studied hard for Olympiad. That is because the questions asked in each exam are very different. I've also written my whole experience in Farsi Here.

This is my exam results for last year. It was quite a good experience to speak to great people and find new friends.

Let's stop it here and return later.
