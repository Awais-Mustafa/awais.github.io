Hi, 

I am Amir Pourmand (امیر پورمند - in Farsi). Currently, I'm pursuing my master's degree in `AI & Robotics` at the Sharif University of Technology under the supervision of [Prof. Hamid R. Rabiee](http://sharif.edu/~rabiee/). 

As a member of `Digital Media Laboratory`, I'm working on "automatic, real-time polyp detection and classification using XAI".

In Aug 2020, I was ranked **1st** among over 16,000 graduate applicants in the Iranian National University Entrance Exam for M.Sc. of Computer Engineering **in 7 (all CE) majors** (this rank is unprecedented in the history of CE University entrance exam). Afterward, In February 2021, I got **Silver Medal** in the 25th Scientific Olympiads for Iranian University Students.

I've also studied computer engineering at [Yazd University](https://yazd.ac.ir/en). 

I've worked as a `software developer` in Amapardazesh company from 2016 to 2020 . That's why I know a lot about clean coding, software architectures, and excellent tools like git, which I use daily.  

I prefer to use GNU-Linux OSes like Manjaro (Arch Linux)  or Kubuntu (KDE + Ubuntu) for my daily usage. I love [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), and this is the main reason I migrated from Windows to GNU-Linux. I'd love to call myself a `computer geek`.
