                There are tons of projects which have worked on Polyp detection and classification. 
                However, there is not enough attention to enhancing the explainability of these methods. I am working 
                to interpret Yolov5 architecture to understand better why the model predicts something (a combined 
                project with the Tehran University of Medical Sciences)."
