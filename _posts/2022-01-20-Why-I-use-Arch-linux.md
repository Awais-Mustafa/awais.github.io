What is really different between distributions? I think the most important ones are `package managers` and `desktop environments`. You can not change package manager in a distribution (It will most probably break), but you can change its desktop environment. I say the last sentence with a grain of salt because in some distros if you want to install another desktop environment, you may also break since there could be lots of conflicts in packages. 

I have used `KDE` and I love it absolutely. It is very beautiful and highly customizable. The first time I saw linux (which was `ubuntu`), I said to myself
"If this is linux, I do not want to ever use it again".

Honestly, I love arch mostly because of its package manager. In early days when I used ubuntu there were the three ways to install any package
- `apt`: Some packages are here but not all of them. Some people recommend `ppa`'s but I hated them since I had to search to find relevant `ppa` to install any package. This is not logical! 
- [snap](https://snapcraft.io/): Some prebuilt packages are here. I would mention telegram and spotify to name a few.
- [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/): Some packages are also here. :)

So, It is basically three places to install any software that I may need to lookup. This is why I don't like `debian-based` distributions. It's all about package manager.
