# VSCode Extensions

## Git 

### [GitGraph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph)

This one shows a very good graph to visualize branches and tags and do all sort of things with them. This one handles most things I need. 

If you want to install it, launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P), paste the following command, and press enter.
```bash
ext install mhutchie.git-graph
```

### Git Lens

I like this one as it shows commit history for each line when open a random file in vscode. 


### [Git Project Manager]()
