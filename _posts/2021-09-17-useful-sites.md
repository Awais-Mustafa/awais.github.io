These are mostly bookmarks I have in my browser. I thought they could be helpful to others, so I compiled them here.

## For Researchers

[Grammarly](grammarly.com)

Just a great tool !

[WordTune](https://www.wordtune.com/)

Basically, it paraphrases my sentences into better ones, and I found this one to be very intelligent too.

[Distill.pub](https://distill.pub/)

Machine Learning researchers should check out this site. There's no better explanation than what its creators say, "[Distill](https://distill.pub/) is dedicated to clear explanations of machine learning."

[Connected Papers](http://connectedpapers.com "Connected Papers")

For researchers, this is an excellent tool, especially when searching for review articles. Enter the paper title, and you'll be able to see a beautiful graph of connected papers, as the name suggests!

[MathPix](https://mathpix.com/)

A powerful program for converting math formulas in Image or PDF to Latex.

[ML Story](https://mlstory.org/)

An intuitive explanation of Machine learning for starters.

[Online Mathematics Editor](https://www.mathcha.io/)

A fast way to write and share mathematics, especially when you don't have access to LATEX. Also, whenever I need to write some formulas, I first come here and write them, then export them into LATEX. It is a lot easier.

[Drawing Diagram](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/)

Best tool (langauge) for drawing a diagram, in my humble opinion, is mermaid. You don't have to use mouse anymore. Just describe what you want and it will render a beatiful diagram. This is also supported in github markdown.

## Tools

[Advanced Photo Editor](https://photopea.com)

Photoshop-like software for editing purposes. I think It is a fantastic alternative for someone like me who, you know, edits photos once a year! If you want something to use daily, I would recommend [Krita](https://krita.org/en/).

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

You can call any API with postman.

[Gitpod](gitpod.io)


[Clipboard Service](https://fastbin.xyz/)

Just another clipboard service which I use

[The official list of applications - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/List_of_applications)

[AUR packages for Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/)

If you are familiar with Arch Linux, you know that these two are the only sites you need to install any software!

[Chaotic AUR](https://pkgs.org/)

A Useful site which provides compiled files to easily install a package

## Useful sites for machine learning

[Papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com)

Reviewing current state-of-the-art in machine learning (SOTA)

[Trend articles everyday](https://mavenlin.github.io/ai_research_trends/)
