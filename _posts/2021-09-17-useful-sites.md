description: Here is a list of websites which I think are great
---

These are mostly the websites bookmarked in my browser. I thought they could be useful to others. So I made this.

## For Researchers

[Connected Papers](http://connectedpapers.com){:target="_blank"}

This is an excellent tool for researchers, especially when finding review articles. All you need to do is to enter the paper's title, and the site shows a beautiful graph of connected papers, as the name suggests!

[Papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com){:target="_blank"}

Browsing state-of-the-art (SOTA) in machine learning

[MathPix](https://mathpix.com/){:target="_blank"}

[ML Story](https://mlstory.org/){:target="_blank"}

[Online Mathematics Editor](https://www.mathcha.io/){:target="_blank"}

A fast way to write and share mathematics, especially when you don't have access to LATEX

## Tools

[Advanced Photo Editor](https://photopea.com){:target="_blank"}

Photoshop-like software for editing purposes. I think It is a fantastic alternative for someone like me who, you know, edits photos once a year! If you want something to use daily, I would recommend [Krita](https://krita.org/en/){:target="_blank"}.

[Official list of applications - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/List_of_applications){:target="_blank"} 

[AUR packages for Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/){:target="_blank"}

If you are familiar with Arch Linux, you know that these two are the only sites you need to install any software!
