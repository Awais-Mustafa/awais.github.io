These are mostly bookmarks I have in my browser. I thought they could be helpful to others, so I compiled them here.

## For Researchers

[Distill.pub](https://distill.pub/)

Machine Learning researchers should check out this site. There's no better explanation than what its creators say, "[Distill ](https://distill.pub/)is dedicated to clear explanations of machine learning."

[Connected Papers](http://connectedpapers.com "Connected Papers")

For researchers, this is an excellent tool, especially when searching for review articles. Enter the paper title, and you'll be able to see a beautiful graph of connected papers, as the name suggests!

[Papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com)

Reviewing current state-of-the-art in machine learning (SOTA)

[MathPix](https://mathpix.com/)

A powerful program for converting math formulas in Image or PDF to Latex.

[ML Story](https://mlstory.org/)

An intuitive explanation of Machine learning for starters.

[Online Mathematics Editor](https://www.mathcha.io/)

A fast way to write and share mathematics, especially when you don't have access to LATEX

## Tools

[Advanced Photo Editor](https://photopea.com)

Photoshop-like software for editing purposes. I think It is a fantastic alternative for someone like me who, you know, edits photos once a year! If you want something to use daily, I would recommend [Krita](https://krita.org/en/).

[The official list of applications - ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/List_of_applications)

[AUR packages for Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/)

If you are familiar with Arch Linux, you know that these two are the only sites you need to install any software!
