Here, I keep my script for installing apps I need on arch linux, particularly manjaro kde. 

As I like to explore softwares, I have usually search a lot for each one and tried to choose the best that fits my needs. Your's may be different. But since you have visited my website, it means that maybe you are a data scientist (or researcher) or you want to be one, so It is highly likely that you like this list!
